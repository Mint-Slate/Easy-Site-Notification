== Description ==

Easy Site Notification is a simple plugin that will allow you to set any div as a site notification/alert and from the admin panel enable and disable the div and set that divs content. We found though many notification plugins are great, they dont allow to place the notification where ever you want and to be able to set the content from the admin. This is made to solve for this issue. 

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Browse to the Site Notification tab inside of your WordPress dashboard for a full breakdown on how configure it.
